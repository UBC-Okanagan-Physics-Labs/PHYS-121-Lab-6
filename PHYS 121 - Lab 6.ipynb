    "## Automated Data Collection...\n",
    "\n",
    "So far in the PHYS 121 lab, we have intentionally had you collect data manually so as to help develop your data-collection skills.  However, there are many situations in which automating the data collection with the help of appropriate hardware and software has clear advantages.  Some examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    " - when one is required to repeat a measurement many thousands of times, it is obviously not practical to do it manually\n",
    " - when one is required to collect data over many days, weeks, months, or years; it is not practical for an individual to continuously monitor the experiment\n",
    " - when data must be collected over very short time intervals, we need to make use of fast electronics to collect the data for us\n",
    " \n",
    "In today's lab, you will collect data while a capacitor charges (**Part 2**) and discharges (**Part 3**).  You will collect hundreds of data points over the span of about one minute.  The maximum data collection rate you will use is $10\\rm\\ samples~per~second$.  Clearly, we're not able to collect data manually at that rate.  In order to automate the data collection we will use hardware and software (LoggerPro) developed by Vernier.  If you completed PHYS 111 at UBCO, you will already have some familiarity with this equipment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Breadboards...\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will use a *breadboard* to build the circuits that you will study. A schematic diagram of the layout of a breadboard is shown in **Fig. 1**.  Breadboards contain arrays of terminals (holes/receptacles) that can be used to quickly assemble and prototype circuits.  \n",

    "</center>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 1** shows that the columns of terminals are labeled $+$, $-$, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, and j.  If you look carefully at the figure, or look at the breadboard at your station, every fifth row of \"terminal strips\" is numbered.  Here's what you need to know about the breadboard terminals:\n",
    "\n",
    " - All of the terminals in a single column labelled $+$ are connected to one another.  These \"power terminals\" are next to a <span style=\"color:red\">red</span> line. \n",
    " - All of the terminals in a single column labelled $-$ are connected to one another.  These \"power terminals\" are next to a <span style=\"color:blue\">blue</span> line.\n",
    " - The $+$ and $-$ power terminals are **NOT** connected to one another.  That is, they're **isolated** from one another.\n",
    " - If there are multiple columns of $+$ power terminals, they are **isolated** from one another.\n",
    " - If there are multiple columns of $-$ power terminals, they are **isolated** from one another.\n",
    " - The a, b, c, d, and e terminals in a *single* row/\"terminal strip\" are connected to one another.\n",
    " - The f, g, h, i, and j terminals in a *single* row/\"terminal strip\" are connected to one another.\n",
    " - The a, b, c, d, and e terminals in a particular row are **isolated** from the f, g, h, i, and j terminals in same row.  Put another way, \"terminal strips\" on either side of a \"divider\" are **NOT** connected, even if they are in the same row.\n",
    " - Terminal strips in different rows are always isolated from one another.\n",
    " \n",
    "Once you become comfortable with the layout of breadboards and the internal connections between terminals, they can be used to very quickly assemble and study electric circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resistors...\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you study circuits made of resistors and capacitors.  Resistors typically have coloured lines painted on them.  These colours are used to indicate the nominal value of the resistor and its tolerance.  **Figure 2** below shows how to decipher the resistor colour code.\n",

    "\n",
    "You will be using resistors with four bands of colour as shown at the top of the figure.  As you can see from the figure, one of the bands (the one on the right) has a noticeably larger gap between it and the next nearest colour.  This band is used to specify the tolorance of the resistor.  The resistor that you'll be using probably has a gold tolerance band which means that the tolerance is $\\pm 5\\%$.  The other three bands are used to specify the value of the resistance.  Starting from the left:\n",
    "\n",
    " - The first band gives the first digit in the value of the resistance.  It is the $X$ in $R = (XY)\\times(\\mathrm{multiplier})$.  In **Fig. 2**, the leftmost band of the top resistor is <span style=\"color:green\">green</span> which corresponds to $X = 5$\n",
    " - The second band gives the second digit in the value of the resistance.  It is the $Y$ in $R = (XY)\\times(\\mathrm{multiplier})$.  In **Fig. 2**, the second band of the top resistor is <span style=\"color:blue\">blue</span> which corresponds to $Y = 6$\n",
    " - The third band gives the value of the $\\mathrm{multiplier}$ in $R = (XY)\\times(\\mathrm{multiplier})$.  In **Fig. 2**, the third band of the top resistor is <span style=\"color:orange\">orange</span> which corresponds to a $\\mathrm{multiplier}$ of $1\\rm k = 1000$.\n",
    " - As already discussed, the rightmost band is <span style=\"color:gold\">gold</span> which corresponds to a tolerance of $\\pm 5\\%$.\n",
    " \n",
    "Therefore, the value of the top resistor in **Fig. 2** is\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "R &= (XY)\\times(\\mathrm{multiplier})\\pm\\mathrm{tolerance}\\\\\n",
    " &= (56)\\times(1000)\\rm\\ \\Omega\\pm 5\\%\\\\\n",
    " &= \\left(56,000\\pm 3,000\\right)\\rm\\ \\Omega\\\\\n",
    "\\therefore R &= \\left(56\\pm 3\\right)\\rm\\ k\\Omega\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to think about the resistor colour code is $R = \\left(XY\\right)\\times 10^N$, where $N$ specifiues the value of the power.  The values of $X$ and $Y$ are exactly as describe above and $N$ is given by the colour of the third band.  For the top resistor in **Fig. 2**, the third band is <span style=\"color:orange\">orange</span> which corresponds to $N = 3$ such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "R &= (XY)\\times 10^N\\pm\\mathrm{tolerance}\\\\\n",

    "\\therefore R &= \\left(56\\pm 3\\right)\\rm\\ k\\Omega\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
